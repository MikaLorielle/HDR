# Statement of Digital Rights, A Common Sense Manifesto for the Digital Age

## Preamble

In today’s digital world, our interactions, creations, and possessions increasingly exist as data, software, and online services. This transition requires new clarity about what it means to **own**, **control**, and **consent** to digital goods and contracts.

This document outlines fundamental rights and protections every user—minor or adult—should have regarding digital products, platforms, and agreements. These rights are grounded in common sense and fairness, recognizing that digital does not mean “less real” or “less owned.”

---

## Evidence Transparency and Accountability

- Governments, companies, and platforms must provide clear, verifiable sources for all data and claims used to justify policies restricting digital rights.  
- Statements about “harm,” “risk,” “safety,” or “exposure” must include context about user agency, consent, and the nature of content engagement.  
- Policies based on unverified, biased, or incomplete data undermine public trust and violate principles of fairness and accountability.  
- Users deserve transparency and balanced information to understand and challenge decisions impacting their digital lives.

---

## Universal Requirement for Evidence Transparency in Lawmaking and Enforcement

- The principles of evidence transparency and accountability must apply equally to all laws, regulations, and enforcement actions—digital or physical.  
- Laws such as KOSA, the Online Safety Act, and others with real-world enforcement consequences must be based on clear, verifiable, and balanced evidence.  
- Without such standards, laws risk becoming instruments of unchecked power, violating citizens’ rights and undermining public trust.

## What Must Be Opt-In (Never Opt-Out)

Certain digital practices are so sensitive or impactful that **explicit, informed opt-in consent is mandatory.** Default opt-out or implied consent is unacceptable for:

- **Personal data collection and processing**, including but not limited to tracking, profiling, behavioral advertising, and biometric data.  
- **Use of cookies or similar technologies** that track users beyond necessary technical functions.  
- **Subscription or paid service enrollment**, no automatic or hidden sign-ups.  
- **Sharing data with third parties or affiliates.**  
- **Automated decision-making or AI profiling** that affects users’ access, restrictions, or content visibility.  
- **Location tracking and access to device sensors (camera, microphone, GPS).**  
- **Collection or use of user-generated content and data (including art, text, voice, interaction logs) for AI training or model development**, companies **MUST NOT** use such data without explicit, informed consent from the user, regardless of age.  

Users must be clearly informed *before* consenting, with simple, transparent language, and retain the right to withdraw consent at any time without penalty.

## 1. Right to True Ownership of Digital Goods

- When users purchase digital products (games, software, media), they must **own** what they pay for, not just receive a temporary license or rental.  
- Companies must not use vague “license agreements” to strip away ownership rights, arbitrarily revoke access, or “brick” devices or software that users rely on.  
- For example, the practice of “bricking” consoles or devices remotely (e.g., Nintendo disabling devices) is unfair if users have legitimately purchased the hardware.  
- Digital ownership rights must mirror real-world protections where you cannot have your physical property arbitrarily disabled or taken away.  

**Legal references:**  
- EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) and UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 recognize digital content rights.  
- Australian Consumer Law prohibits unfair contract terms that misrepresent ownership.  

---

## 2. Right to Fair and Transparent Digital Contracts

- Digital contracts (terms of service, EULAs, subscriptions) must be written clearly and provided before purchase or use.  
- Users must have the right to a **fixed-term contract** without unexpected mid-term changes, such as price hikes or altered service terms.  
- Sudden changes to digital service terms without explicit consent or fair renegotiation violate consumer protections.  
- Real-life analogy: You wouldn’t accept a landlord increasing rent 10x after signing a one-year lease without notice or consent; the same principle applies to digital subscriptions.

**Legal references:**  
- UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 and EU Directive 93/13/EEC protect against unfair terms and unilateral changes.  
- Australian Consumer Law requires transparency and fairness in consumer contracts.

---

## 3. Right to Meaningful Consent for Data and Surveillance

- Digital platforms must obtain clear, informed, opt-in consent before collecting or using personal data, regardless of user age.  
- Adults must retain control to revoke or modify consent without penalty or service loss.  
- Minors aged 14-17 should be recognized as capable of giving meaningful consent, rather than being lumped with much younger children.  
- Blanket bans or excessive surveillance justified as “protection” harm everyone’s digital autonomy.

**Legal references:**  
- GDPR Article 8 and related provisions encourage recognition of minors’ evolving capacity.  
- COPPA protects children under 13 but does not justify blanket restrictions on older teens.  
- South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act enforces strict data consent rules.

---

## 4. Right to Freedom from Arbitrary Censorship and Content Restrictions

- Platforms must not impose arbitrary age-based censorship or content bans without clear justification and due process.  
- Content restrictions should be transparent, narrowly defined, and include accessible appeals.  
- Blanket bans based on AI age profiling or vague “community standards” risk silencing mature minors and adults alike.  
- Censorship should never replace open dialogue and democratic governance.

**Legal references:**  
- European Convention on Human Rights Article 10 protects freedom of expression with limited exceptions.  
- US First Amendment defends speech from government censorship; private platforms must balance policies responsibly.

---

## 5. Right to Control Digital Presence and Data

- Users have the right to access, download, modify, or delete their digital data and accounts at any time.  
- Platforms must not use manipulative design (“dark patterns”) to trap users into unwanted subscriptions or data sharing.  
- Digital autonomy is essential to prevent exploitation and preserve trust.

---

## 6. Additional Concerns and Real-Life Comparisons

- Forced subscription models and “service rentals” undermine the traditional concept of ownership and long-term access.  
- Just as you cannot rent a physical car and have it disabled remotely by the company for minor breaches, digital goods should not be revoked or disabled arbitrarily.  
- The move towards “licenses” instead of ownership in digital media, software, and hardware raises serious fairness and consumer protection issues.  
- Vague “community guidelines” or policies are often weaponized against inconvenient speech, especially from marginalized groups.

---

## 7. Right to Protection from Deceptive Practices and Forced Restrictions

- Companies and platforms **MAY NOT** use deceptive or manipulative practices to collect data, restrict content, or force users to disable safety and privacy tools such as VPNs, Proxies, ad blockers, or tracker blockers.  
- Blocking or penalizing users for employing essential tools designed to protect their privacy and security is a violation of digital rights.  
- All restrictions on content or services must be transparent, justified, and not rely on covert or unfair enforcement methods that degrade user safety under the guise of “protection.”  
- Users must be given clear, honest choices without being coerced, tricked, or misled into surrendering control over their digital experience.  
- **Coercion in any form is prohibited**, no user, company, or government entity may use force, threats, intimidation, or undue pressure to obtain consent, compliance, or control over digital services and data.  
- Consent must be freely given, informed, and revocable without fear of retaliation or penalty from any party.  
- Companies may **NOT** force users to repeatedly accept new or changed terms retroactively as a condition to continue using a service without clear, reasonable notice and the option to decline or exit without penalty.  
- Initial acceptance of terms should not be undermined by surprise “double consent” demands or hidden changes that block access unfairly.  
- Platforms **MAY NOT** require users to undergo AI-driven age estimation, studies, biometric scans, credit card verification, or ID checks without explicit, informed opt-in consent. Such practices constitute forced data harvesting and violate user rights.  
- Threats to delete, suspend, or restrict accounts as leverage to coerce users into surrendering personal data or consenting to invasive tracking are strictly prohibited.

### Special Considerations for Vulnerable Individuals

Unfair digital practices and invasive data collection disproportionately harm people with mental health challenges, physical disabilities, whistleblowers, activists, and marginalized creators.  
These groups often rely on privacy tools, anonymity, and stable digital access to maintain safety, health, and livelihoods.  
Protections outlined in this manifesto are essential to uphold their rights and well-being in the digital world.

## Conclusion

This manifesto demands a digital ecosystem where users’ rights to ownership, consent, transparency, and freedom are respected as fully as in the physical world. Digital does not mean diminished autonomy or fairness. Governments, companies, and platforms must recognize and uphold these principles in law and practice.
